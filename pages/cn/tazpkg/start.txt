以下命令列出已安装的bc软件的所包含的所有文件清单:
<code>
 # tazpkg list-files bc
</code>

===== search =====


Search for packages by owner or package name. This command will search for the term wanted in the installed packages and the list of available packages on the mirror. To obtain the latest list of installable packages on the mirror, just run 'tazpkg recharge' before conducting a search:

 # tazpkg search gcc
===== search-file =====


The 'search-file' command allows you to search for a file among the files installed by the packages. This command is very useful to find the full path to a file and determine if a file is present on the system. Example:

 $ tazpkg search-file libnss
===== install =====


This command allows the installation of a local package with the .tazpkg extension. See 'get-install' to install a package from the internet. Note that you can force the installation via the --forced, uninstall and reinstall options or specify the root system where you want to install the packages via the -root= option:

 # tazpkg install package-1.0.tazpkg
 Or :
 # tazpkg install path/to/package-1.0.tazpkg --forced
 Or :
 # tazpkg install path/to/package-1.0.tazpkg --root=/mnt/rootfs
===== install-list or get-install-list =====


Install a set of packages listed in a file. This command allows you to (download and) install several packages with a single command and can also be forced:

 # tazpkg install-list my-packages.list
 # tazpkg get-install-list my-packages.list --forced
===== link =====


This command allows the installation of a package from another media device. The set up is done through symbolic links and consumes very little memory. It is generally used within the system RAM to install add-ons from an USB key:

 # tazpkg link openoffice /media/usbdisk
===== remove =====


Remove a package. You will be asked for confirmation (y/N). This command will delete all files installed with the package. To view the list of files, use the 'list-files' command followed by the name of the package. Example with the package bc:

 # tazpkg remove bc
===== extract =====


Extract a package into a directory. If you do not specify the destination directory, the package will be extracted in the current directory using the name package-version:

 # tazpkg extract package.tazpkg
 # tazpkg extract package.tazpkg target/dir
===== pack =====


The 'pack' command will create a package from a directory prepared in advance or from an unpacked package. It can also manually create a .tazpkg package (see the Tazwok documentation for the automatic creation of packages). To pack a package:

 # tazpkg pack package-version
===== repack =====


The 'repack' command allows you to recreate a package from the files on a system where it was previously installed. To repack a package:

 # tazpkg repack package
===== repack-config =====


The 'repack-config' command recreates a package of the system configuration files (see list-config). It is enough to install the package to find the current configuration. To repack the configuration files:

 # tazpkg repack-config
===== recharge =====


Recharge the list of available packages on the mirror. This command will download the most recent 'packages.list' of installable packages on the mirror and before starting will save the old list. Once the list is updated you can then use the 'list' and 'search' commands. To view and list the differences, you can use 'list-mirror --diff', and to view and update packages, you can simply 'upgrade'. To recharge the latest list of packages:

 # tazpkg recharge
===== upgrade =====


Upgrade allows you to update all installed packages available on the current mirror. Upgrading packages is an important part of system security, it helps to keep you secure with the latest updates and fixes. The SliTaz project, although tiny, provides regular updates on security and generally offers the latest versions of software. Note that this function is aimed at people with SliTaz installed on a hard drive. Updated packages in LiveCD mode will be lost on system shutdown. To upgrade:

 # tazpkg upgrade
===== check =====


The 'check' command can check dependencies on installed packages and determine whether all the files needed for the repacking of packages are present:

 # tazpkg check package
block or unblock

The 'block' and 'unblock' commands permit you to block installed package versions so that they are not maintained by an 'upgrade'. The list of packages on hold are contained in the /var/lib/tazpkg/blocked-packages.list. This file can also be edited by hand. To block or unblock a package such as Grub:

 # tazpkg block grub
 Or :
 # tazpkg unblock grub
===== get =====


Get a package from the mirror (if it exists). The downloaded package is stored in the current directory. To find the path you can use 'pwd'. To get the Grub package:

 # tazpkg get grub
===== get-install =====


Get and install a package from a mirror on the internet. The 'get-install' command begins by checking whether the package exists on the mirror and if it has been already downloaded. For a list of packages on the mirror, we must use the 'list-mirror' command. To install the package Grub:

 # tazpkg get-install grub
===== clean-cache =====


Remove *.tazpkg packages downloaded to the cache. During installation, Tazpkg keeps a copy of packages downloaded from the web. This is done to save bandwidth in case of reinstallation, but you may want to free up space on the hard drive or re-download the packages:

 # tazpkg clean-cache
===== setup-mirror =====


Setup the URL for the mirror. The 'setup-mirror' command will ask for the URL of the new mirror. You can specify multiple URLs separated by spaces. Note that you can also modify the main /var/lib/tazpkg/mirror file. The URL must point to the directory containing the 'packages.list' and packages:

 # tazpkg setup-mirror
===== reconfigure =====


Replays the post-install script from the package. Example using gcc:

 # tazpkg reconfigure gcc
===== depends or rdepends =====


Displays a dependency tree or reverse dependency tree for a package. Examples using mpd:

 # tazpkg depends mpd
 # tazpkg rdepends mpd
===== add-undigest or setup-undigest =====


Set the URL of an additional unofficial mirror to test packages that are not yet present on the official mirrors. Note, you can also manually edit the file in /var/lib/tazpkg/undigest/'repository'. The URL must point to the directory containing the packages and 'packages.list':

 # tazpkg add-undigest public-repository http://my.home.org/slitaz
 # tazpkg setup-undigest local-repository /home/slitaz/packages
===== remove-undigest =====


Removes the URL of an undigest mirror:

 # tazpkg remove-undigest my-repository
list-undigest

===== Lists additional undigest mirrors: =====


 # tazpkg list-undigest
===== convert =====


Converts a Debian package (.deb), Redhat (.rpm), Slackware (.tgz) or Archlinux (.pkg.tar.gz) package into a SliTaz package (.tazpkg):

 # tazpkg convert alien-package
set-release

The 'set-release' command changes the current version and upgrades the packages to the latest release:

 # tazpkg set-release cooking
===== bugs =====


Generates a list of known bugs in the packages:

 # tazpkg bugs
